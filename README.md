# defi-api-examples

This repository comprise a set of scripts that leverages BD's DEFI API. The script collection guides the creation of an application that leverages the DEFI API and has cross-chain token transfer capabilities. This example comprises cross-chain operations where the source chain is Optimism and the target chain Polygon.

### Requirements
This is a Typescript project. Npm as package manager and node. Tested with npm v10.2.4, node 21.5.0. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for node version management.

## Getting started

### Running the tool

1. Install node 21.5.0 (using nvm: `nvm install 21.5.0 && nvm use 21.5.0`)

2. Install the dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/): `pnpm install`.

3. Copy the environment variables with `cp .env.example .env`.
4. Generate a [Blockdaemon API Key](https://www.blockdaemon.com/api/pricing).

5. You will need a wallet (blockchain address, private keys) to interact with the blockchains. We currently support EVM blockchains - if you do not have an account or want to generate a new one you may run the script `create-wallet` with `npm exec ts-node src/main/utils/create-wallet.ts`. This code locally generates a wallet, including the mnemonic you will need to sign transactions. Please make sure you add funds to the generated (or the provided) address, in particular in the blockchains you are interacting with.

6. Populate the variables, including your Blockdaemon API Key (BLOCKDAEMON_API_KEY), the private key that you will be using to sign transactions in the form of a mnemonic ([MNEMONIC](https://support.metamask.io/configure/wallet/how-to-reveal-your-secret-recovery-phrase/)), and RECEIVER_ADDRESS (can be the same). The standard initialisation code will read and validate the entries in your `.env` file.

7. Run the scripts with `npm exec ts-node src/main/scripts/SCRIPT.ts`, where `SCRIPT` can be:

* `do-swap` (performs a cross-chain token transfer from sender to receiver based on the first received route); 
* `get-approvals` (gets the status of an approval)
* `get-chains` (gets the list of supported chains)
* `get-prices` (gets token prices from a wide range of blockchains)
* `get-routes` (gets a set of routes that satisfy a swap); 
* `get-status` (gets the status for a transaction); 
* `get-tokens-by-tag` (gets the list of supported tokens by specified tag)
* `get-tokens` (gets the list of supported tokens)
* `get-transactions` (gets the list of transactions for an address, over different chains)
* `make-approvals` (creates a spend approval for an ERC20 token)

We also have the following utility scripts, under `src/main/utils`:
* `sign-and-broadcast-transaction (utility script)` (signs and broadcasts a transaction to the blockchain)
* `create-wallet (utility script)` (locally creates an EVM wallet)


## Examples
There are example applications under `src/main/examples` that illustrate the functionalities and flexibility of the DEFI APIs. More information about each specific app is in its `README.md`. Currently we have one example app at `src/main/examples/rebalancing-app`.

### Legal Warning ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®

The example applications provided in this repository are intended solely as starting points to help you learn about the DEFI API and its capabilities. We do not provide any guarantees regarding their usage, and they should not be used in production environments. For more information or assistance, please contact our team through our [support page](https://www.blockdaemon.com/support).

### Rebalancing-app
Rebalancing ensures that monitored token balances remain within predefined thresholds. This is vital in an environment where liquidity is critical (operational efficiency, risk mitigation, automation). The rebalancing application (`rebalance-main.ts`) demonstrates how to maintain healthy token balances by monitoring and correcting imbalances between accounts using Blockdaemon's DEFI API. By combining several API endpoints to check balances, fetch token data, calculate swap routes, and execute token transfers, the tool ensures liquidity is maintained and trading or operational objectives are met.

## Common issues and Troubleshooting
For issues related to the code in this repository, please use the [issues tracker](https://github.com/Blockdaemon/defi-api-examples/issues). 

#### Why do I need to put a mnemonic in the .env?
The mnemonic phrase is required to derive the private keys needed for signing transactions. This example uses a mnemonic to:

1. Generate wallet instances for both Optimism and Polygon chains  
2. Sign cross-chain token transfer transactions  
3. Broadcast signed transactions through Blockdaemon's RPC endpoints  

The wallet instances (`optimismWallet` and `polygonWallet`) are created using the mnemonic and can be used with either:  
- [web3js library](https://docs.web3js.org/) for Web3 interactions  
- [ethers library](https://docs.ethers.org/) for Ethereum interactions  
- [Blockdaemon RPC API](https://docs.blockdaemon.com/reference/rpc-overview) for blockchain network access  

Never share your mnemonic phrase or add it to version control. Keep it secure and use it only for testing with small amounts. The mnemonic is local to your environment and is not shared with the DEFI API.

#### Cannot see output of scripts?
If script output is missing, enable more verbose logging by setting the logger environment variable to either ‚Äúdebug‚Äù or ‚Äútrace.‚Äù For example, in your .env file:

`LOG_LEVEL=debug`

E.g., in `get-transactions.ts`, the ‚Äúlogger.debug(...)‚Äù calls will appear in your console output when you run the script. You can apply the same approach in other files to troubleshoot logging issues.

#### No funds on wallet
To run the scripts that perform write actions on the blockchain (namely excecuting a swap), the source chain wallet (the sender) needs to have enough funds to do the transfers. See how to top up the Metamask wallet in the [official metamask page](https://metamask.io/).
